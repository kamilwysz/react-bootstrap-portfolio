I devote for learning every free moment, and because it gives me pleasure, I'd like it to become my job as well. I decided on a Front-end, because I pay attention to the appearance of websites and I like to see effects of my actions. For creating projects I use mostly React, but I always try to use something new, to learn as much as possible. I would like to work as Junior Front-end Developer.",
